# Text Mining on Twitter (selenium and BeautifulSoup) for Sentiment Analysis (BERT from Hugging Face)

In this project, a text mining process was applied to Twitter to collect posts or tweets related to a specific topic. Twitter, also known as X, was chosen because it focuses on text, and the text content is typically short. The chosen topic was the AFC Cup referee, which created a trending keyword "wasit" (referee) on Twitter from Indonesia's last match on April 29 to May 1 2024.

The text mining process utilized the [selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) library for browser automation and [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for text extraction from HTML. The collected tweets then underwent sentiment analysis using a BERT-based model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
